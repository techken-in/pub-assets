    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: A single-page application with a fixed sidebar navigation. This structure was chosen to provide users with a clear, persistent overview of all policy sections, allowing them to jump between complex documents like "Privacy Policy" and "Terms and Conditions" without losing context or having to scroll through one long page. The main content area updates dynamically. This enhances usability by making dense legal text more manageable and less intimidating. An interactive chart is included in the Privacy section to visually summarize data collection practices, making it instantly understandable. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: "Information We Collect" section of the Privacy Policy.
        - Goal: Inform users about the types of data collected in a quickly digestible format.
        - Viz/Presentation Method: A doughnut chart created with Chart.js.
        - Interaction: Hovering over chart segments reveals tooltips with the specific data category.
        - Justification: A visual breakdown is more engaging and easier to understand than a dense list of text, improving transparency.
        - Library/Method: Chart.js (Canvas).

        - Report Info: All policy sections (Privacy, Shipping, Terms, etc.).
        - Goal: Organize and allow easy navigation between distinct legal documents.
        - Viz/Presentation Method: A vertical navigation menu (HTML/Tailwind) and corresponding content panels.
        - Interaction: Clicking a navigation link hides the current policy and shows the selected one.
        - Justification: This standard SPA navigation pattern is intuitive and prevents users from being overwhelmed by a single, massive document.
        - Library/Method: Vanilla JavaScript for DOM manipulation.

                        <li><strong>Before Shipment:</strong> Buyers may be able to cancel an order before the seller has shipped the product.

                    <h3>2. Order Cancellation by Seller</h3>

                        <li><strong>Communication:</strong> We encourage buyers and sellers to communicate directly to resolve any cancellation-related issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>Our Role:</strong> `[Your App Name]` may mediate disputes related to cancellations, but our decision will be final.</li>
                    </ul>
